## Personal Resume

In this project, I wanted to re-create my resume (which I made with Adobe Illustrator some time ago) with code and be able to download a PDF version of it to myself. This way it's easier and faster to make changes to it (the code) and save the latest version.

I made the resume with React. I practiced making animated bars to make the resume look fun. I also practiced making A4 layout with grid system.

At the moment, the resume can be downloaded by clicking right (on the resume) -> Print -> Save as PDF.
